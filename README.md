# REAL-ESTATE-INVESTMENT-ANALYSIS

In this project, I analyzed Real Estate Investment Trusts, commonly known as REITs. REITs are companies that own or operate real estate that produces income. REITs, like the stocks of regular public companies, are traded on different stock exchanges. Investing in a REIT allows you to invest in portfolios of real estate assets the same way you can invest in a company by buying its stock.

Using financial statistics and NumPy I analyzed two REITs: Sabra Health Care REIT Inc. (NASDAQ: SBRA), which invests in health care real estate, and Equity Residential (NASDAQ:EQR), which invests in rental apartment properties.

At the end of the project, the correlation analysis showed that both investments are positively correlated, that is, as one variable increases, the other variable increases as well and vice-versa.
